# Prostate-Cancer

A classification model that deals with real data to classify prostate cancer types by (the Glasson Score). We evaluate the models that perform well in structured data. It's known that tree-based methods are the state of the art when we are talking about structured data thus we will train and evaluate LightGBM, XGboost, Random Forests and ExtraTreeClassifier. Linear models like logistic regression and support vector machines didn't perform well in this problem so I won't consider them in my final submission.
